Create User Model
First, create a User model for SQLAlchemy. Put this in a models.py file.

It should have the following columns:

id, an autoincrementing integer number that is the primary key
first_name and last_name
image_url for profile images
Make good choices about whether things should be required, have defaults, and so on.

Create Flask App
Next, create a skeleton Flask app. You can pattern match from the lecture demo.

It should be able to import the User model, and create the tables using SQLAlchemy. Make sure you have the FlaskDebugToolbar installed — it’s especially helpful when using SQLAlchemy.

Make a Base Template
Add a base template with slots for the page title and content. Your other templates should use this.

You can use Bootstrap for this project, but don’t spend a lot of time worrying about styling — this is not a goal of this exercise.

Make routes for the following:

GET /
Redirect to list of users. (We’ll fix this in a later step).
GET /users
Show all users.

Make these links to view the detail page for the user.

Have a link here to the add-user form.

GET /users/new
Show an add form for users
POST /users/new
Process the add form, adding a new user and going back to /users
GET /users/[user-id]
Show information about the given user.

Have a button to get to their edit page, and to delete the user.

GET /users/[user-id]/edit
Show the edit page for a user.

Have a cancel button that returns to the detail page for a user, and a save button that updates the user.

POST /users/[user-id]/edit
Process the edit form, returning the user to the /users page.
POST /users/[user-id]/delete
Delete the user.
